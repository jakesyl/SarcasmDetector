SarcasmDetector
===============

This is a Sarcasm Detector we built for the NLP Project. We start off by implementing a state of the art method, then we try to make that better and try to implement another method to compare if necessary. 

First off we start by implementing this Sarcasm paper that uses context from EMNLP 2013 - www.cs.utah.edu/~huangrh/official-sarcasm-cameraReady-v2.pdf

3 phases

1. Bootstrapping positive sentiments and negative situations    --- Completion Expected : 25th November
2. Adding positive predicates.   ---- Completion Expected : 25th November
3. Implementing SVM with unigram and bigram features, so that we can plug in both of them.  ---Completion Expected : 26th November
