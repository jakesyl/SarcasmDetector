Sarcasm Detector - Bootstrapping 

- Vinodh Krishnan and Vivek Nabhi, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta USA

To run : python step1.py

Input : 
File containing positive tweets - positiveTweets.txt
File containing negative tweets - negativeTweets.txt
File containing the parts of speech tags - posFile.txt

Output
positiveWords.txt
negativeWords.txt
positivepredicateWords.txt

These are the results of bootstrapping. Use this to classify the tweets as sarcastic or not. 

Caution : The program takes a lot of time to run (3-4 hours), please see the code and minimise the number of iterations if you want it ot end quicker. RIght now it runs until no more words are added to the positive dataset. 

To evaluate 

Use the testMethod.py in Evaluation folder along with the positiveWords.txt, negativeWords.txt and positivepredicatewords.txt to get resultsFile.txt which contains the final tags for the test tweets with the word sets generated by bootstrapping. Then use the evaluation.py to get your final recall and precision. 

The recall obtained is 9.7 and the precision is 72.4. Use with SVM as described in the paper to increase the recall.
